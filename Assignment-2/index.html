                I love it when you call me señorita<br>
                I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya<br>
                But every touch is ooh, la-la-la<br>
                It's true, la-la-la<br>
                Ooh, I should be running<br>
                Ooh, you keep me coming for ya<br>
                Land in Miami<br>
                The air was hot from summer rain<br>
                Sweat dripping off me<br>
                Before I even knew her name, la-la-la<br>
                It felt like ooh, la-la-la<br>
                Yeah, no<br>
                Sapphire moonlight<br>
                We danced for hours in the sand<br>
                Tequila sunrise<br>
                Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la<br>
                It felt like ooh, la-la-la, yeah<br>
                I love it when you call me señorita<br>
                I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya<br>
                But every touch is ooh, la-la-la<br>
                It's true, la-la-la<br>
                Ooh, I should be running<br>
                Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita<br>
                I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya<br>
                But every touch is ooh, la-la-la<br>
                It's true, la-la-la<br>
                Ooh, I should be running<br>
                Ooh, you keep me coming for ya<br>
                Locked in the hotel<br>
                There's just some things that never change<br>
                You say we're just friends<br>
                But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la<br>
                'Cause you know it's been a long time coming<br>
                Don't you let me fall, oh<br>
                Ooh, when your lips undress me<br>
                Hooked on your tongue<br>
                Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly<br>
                Don't stop<br>
                I love it when you call me señorita<br>
                I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya<br>
                But every touch is ooh, la-la-la<br>
                It's true, la-la-la<br>

                Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita<br>
                I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya<br>
                But every touch is ooh, la-la-la<br>

                Ooh, you keep me coming for ya<br>
                All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)<br>
                And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)<br>
                Call my name, I'll be coming for ya<br>
                Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya<br>
                For ya
                For ya (oh, she loves it when I call)<br>
                For ya
