                <h2 id="intro">Introducing the magnificent flavours</h2>
                <p>Cadbury produces a variety of popular chocolate brands including Dairy Milk, Crunchie, Double Decker, Caramel, Wispa, Boost, Picnic, Flake, Curly Wurly, Chomp, and Fudge. They also offer chocolate Buttons, the boxed chocolates Milk Tray, and the twist-wrapped chocolates Heroes, which are especially popular during holidays like Christmas and Halloween. For Halloween, Cadbury releases Goo Heads, similar to Creme Eggs. Selection boxes containing an assortment of Cadbury bars and sweets are a traditional Christmas gift in Britain, a practice that has been around for over a century. Cadbury Roses have been a part of this tradition since the late 1930s. Creme Eggs, available only from New Year's Day until Easter, are the most popular chocolate in the UK during this period, outselling their closest rival by a 2 to 1 margin.

                    In addition to its chocolate products, Cadbury owns brands like Maynards and Halls and is associated with various confectionery items including Liquorice Allsorts, Jelly Babies, Flumps, Mints, Black Jack chews, Trident gum, and Softmints. Global sales of Cadbury products amounted to £491 million in the 52 weeks leading up to August 16, 2014.</p>
                <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                <p> 1800–1900: Early History

                    John Cadbury, a Quaker, began selling tea, coffee, and drinking chocolate in Birmingham, England, in 1824. By 1831, he was producing cocoa and drinking chocolates in a factory on Bridge Street, mainly for the wealthy due to high production costs. In 1847, he partnered with his brother Benjamin, forming "Cadbury Brothers." That same year, Cadbury introduced their chocolate bar, competing with Fry's of Bristol. The Cadbury brothers received the royal warrant in 1854 as manufacturers of chocolate and cocoa to Queen Victoria. 
                    
                    In 1861, John Cadbury's sons, Richard and George, took over the declining business and turned it around by focusing on high-quality chocolate. The major breakthrough came in 1866 with an improved cocoa press that removed some cocoa butter from the beans. Cadbury began exporting in the 1850s and introduced Fancy Boxes of chocolates in 1861 and heart-shaped boxes for Valentine's Day in 1868. They produced their first Easter egg in 1875, and by 1893, offered 19 varieties.
                    
                    The Cadbury brothers built a new factory in 1878 in the countryside, creating the Bournville estate. By 1900, the estate had 314 houses on 330 acres. In 1897, Cadbury introduced milk chocolate bars following Swiss companies' lead, and by 1899, it was incorporated as a private limited company.
                    
                    1900–1969
                    
                    In 1905, Cadbury launched Dairy Milk, a high-quality milk chocolate bar that became their best-selling product by 1914. Cadbury also introduced Milk Tray in 1915 and supported the British war effort during WWI. After the war, they opened their first overseas factory in Tasmania. In 1919, Cadbury merged with Fry's, integrating brands like Fry's Chocolate Cream and Fry's Turkish Delight.
                    
                    During the interwar period, Cadbury expanded its product range with Flake (1920), Creme Eggs (1923), Fruit and Nut (1928), and Crunchie (1929). By the mid-1930s, chocolate was affordable for most of the British population. During WWII, parts of the Bournville factory were used for war work, and normal production resumed post-war with new factories and increased demand.
                    
                    Cadbury acquired an Australian confectioner, MacRobertson's, in 1967, securing a significant market share in Australia. 
                    
                     Schweppes Merger (1969)
                    
                    In 1969, Cadbury merged with Schweppes to form Cadbury Schweppes. This merger ended Cadbury's close links to its Quaker founding family and led to significant acquisitions and expansions in the confectionery and beverage markets. The successful Wispa chocolate bar was launched in 1981, and by 1982, trading profits outside Britain surpassed those within the UK. 
                    
                     2007–2010
                    
                    Cadbury announced the closure of the Somerdale Factory in 2007, transferring production to other plants. In 2009, Kraft Foods made a takeover bid for Cadbury, which was initially rejected but eventually accepted in January 2010, valuing Cadbury at £11.5 billion. The acquisition faced disapproval from the British public and trade unions, with concerns about job losses and the impact on the British economy.
                    
                     Acquisition and Subsidiary (2009–present)
                    
                    Kraft Foods acquired Cadbury in 2010, leading to significant changes and restructuring. Cadbury became a subsidiary of Mondelez International in 2012. Mondelez implemented a cost-cutting program, leading to factory closures in several developed countries and shifting production to lower-cost locations. 
                    
                    In January 2017, Cadbury became the official snack partner of the Premier League. In January 2024, Mondelez International announced plans to celebrate Cadbury's 200th anniversary with various promotions and retro packaging designs for Dairy Milk bars.</p>
